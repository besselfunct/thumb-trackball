# The Future Home of the Ploopy Thumb Trackball*

![The Ploopy Thumb Trackball](ploopy-thumb.png)

This is the future home of the Ploopy Thumb Trackball, a high-performance thumb trackball with similar components and performance to [our original](https://github.com/ploopyco/trackball).

If you've got a printer and some free time, it'd be great if you grabbed a copy of the *shape-test.stl* file, printed it out, and gave it a spin. And, drop us some feedback, at **contact (at) ploopy [dot] co**.


**Still working on a name. Might change later.*
